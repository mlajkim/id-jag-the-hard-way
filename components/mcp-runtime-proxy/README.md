# MCP Runtime Proxy

`mcp-runtime-proxy` is the pod-local Athenz-protected front door for an MCP server. It verifies the Gateway-issued Athenz access token before forwarding protected MCP requests to the colocated MCP container.

The proxy verifies the JWT's RS256 signature against ZTS JWKS, requires an unexpired token, checks the configured audience, and requires the configured accessor scope. It does not fetch Athenz policies: successful token issuance and the signed token claims are the authorization evidence for this shared server-access boundary.

MCP protocol bootstrap, `ping`, and `tools/list` remain public so the Hub can discover tools before a user has access. Other requests fail closed with `401` for a missing or invalid token, `403` for a missing scope, and `503` when ZTS signing keys cannot be loaded. Denials are logged without logging the token.

Runtime logs default to one-line text with a timestamp, severity, event category, and request ID. Each line has one small marker: `→` for incoming requests, `✓` for successful steps, `·` for other information, `!` for warnings, and `×` for errors. Terminal output colors only the severity marker and label; redirected output stays free of color codes. Set `NO_COLOR=1` to disable terminal colors or `LOG_FORMAT=json` to retain the original structured JSON format.

Protected calls emit `request_received`, `access_token_verified`, and `request_completed` events (shown with spaces in text mode). The verified event includes the signed token's subject, user ID, client ID, audiences, scopes, signing-key ID, and expiry information. Public calls and failures have distinct events. Upstream HTTP 4xx responses are warnings and 5xx responses are errors. Authorization headers and raw token values are never logged.

## Request path

```text
MCP client
  -> MCP Gateway
  -> Core MCP Proxy
  -> Kubernetes Service
  -> MCP Runtime Proxy :8082
  -> MCP container on MCP_TARGET_URL
```

The MCP credential broker remains on the client. MCP Gateway exchanges the signed-in user's identity for the narrowly scoped Athenz access token. The Runtime Proxy validates that token and preserves its `Authorization` header for the colocated MCP container. It must target that container directly; targeting MCP Gateway would create a routing loop.

For a configured downstream tool scope, Gateway also sends the selected scope in the internal `x-idthw-mcp-downstream-scope` header. Runtime Proxy requires that exact fully qualified scope in the verified incoming token, strips the internal header, and uses its managed MCP service certificate for RFC 8693 access-token exchange. It writes the exchanged token atomically to a unique request file:

```text
/var/run/idthw-access-tokens/<tool-name>/<request-uuid>.jwt
```

The forwarded `tools/call` receives the path in `params._meta["mcp.idthw.dev/access-token-file"]`. The MCP container mounts this directory read-only and must reread the file immediately before the downstream request. Runtime Proxy removes the file after the MCP response ends. Per-request paths prevent concurrent users of the same tool from overwriting each other's delegated tokens. The initial implementation accepts downstream scopes from exactly one Athenz domain per tool call.

For new Hub-managed servers, Runtime Proxy also manages the selected Athenz service identity. Its bootstrap private-key Secret is mounted only in this container. On startup, the proxy uses `zts-svccert` and the per-server key ID supplied by MCP Hub to obtain a service certificate, verifies that the certificate matches the private key, and publishes both into a separate Kubernetes Secret. Runtime Proxy and the MCP container both mount that published identity read-only as `/var/run/athenz/service.cert.pem` and `/var/run/athenz/service.key.pem`. The proxy refreshes the identity every 24 hours and retries a failed scheduled refresh after five minutes without deleting the last good identity.

Hub-managed deployments set the audience to `mcp-hub.mcps.<project>`, require `mcp-hub.mcps.<project>:role.accessor`, and mount the Athenz CA from the project-local `mcp-runtime-proxy-athenz-ca` ConfigMap. MCP Hub idempotently refreshes that ConfigMap from its configured Athenz CA when a Hub-managed server is created or updated.

The incoming path and query string are appended to `MCP_TARGET_URL`. For example, `/mcp` is forwarded to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/mcp` with request and response streaming preserved.

The core tutorial uses the existing AI Client Gateway and MCP adapter with `MCP_PUBLIC_OPENAPI_ENABLED=true`. Tool routes still require the accessor scope. Public MCP methods are recognized only on the configured MCP path (`MCP_READINESS_PATH`, default `/mcp`). The adapter performs downstream token exchange, so `ATHENZ_TOKEN_FILE_EXCHANGE_ENABLED` remains `false`; Runtime Proxy needs no service identity or token-file volume in this flow.

`GET /healthz` is a process liveness check. `GET /readyz` performs an MCP-standard lifecycle against the colocated server: `initialize`, `notifications/initialized`, `ping`, and `tools/list`, followed by best-effort session cleanup. It returns `503` until that lifecycle succeeds, so Kubernetes readiness reflects the MCP protocol rather than only the proxy process.
