# IDTHW Hub Agent Notes

This full-stack Next.js application is the IDTHW Hub. It hosts multiple product surfaces and server-side APIs. MCP Hub remains one product inside it, alongside Gen AI and future IDTHW products.

The MCP Hub is mock-first, but its end goal is real: providers should be able to register MCP servers and have the hub create the runtime deployment for that MCP server.

## Product Direction

- Keep PRs small. Prefer the minimum change that makes the next product step clear.
- Treat the catalog as the entry point, not the whole product.
- The main provider flow is: register MCP server -> define managed policies/tools -> create deployment/pods -> expose connection details.
- The main consumer flow is: discover MCP server -> inspect tools and managed policies -> attach/grant access through ID-JAG.
- Do not spend large PRs only polishing dummy catalog data unless it directly supports one of those flows.

## Product Goals

Users should be able to:

- See public MCP servers.
- See what tools exist for each MCP server.
- See what actions are available for those tools.
- Eventually see resources too, but actions are the first priority.
- See how to register or connect to an MCP server.

MCP providers should be able to:

- Create/register an MCP server with a container image.
- Assign a service account.
- Have MCP pods/deployments created automatically in Kubernetes.
- Have those pods health checked automatically.

Registration is a real product goal. Users/providers should eventually be able to register their MCP server through the UI, but do not introduce a database by default. Start from Kubernetes as the source of truth: deployed MCP workloads, Services, labels, and annotations should drive the catalog until there is a concrete need for draft state, audit history, approvals, or richer metadata that Kubernetes cannot reasonably hold.

## Current State

- The app is standalone under `components/idthw_hub/`.
- It uses Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS imports, and mostly hand-written CSS in `app/globals.css`.
- `make local` runs the app on port `3102`.
- Projects are read directly from Kubernetes Namespaces and are selectable from the top bar or the product-level **Projects** page. The shared project-name predicate excludes `default`, every `kube-*` namespace, the Hub control namespace, local storage infrastructure, and the `agent-gateway`, `ai`, `athenz`, `human`, and `idp` platform namespaces; reuse that predicate when project creation is added. There is no create-project flow yet.
- The catalog page fetches MCP server rows from the local Next API route `/api/mcp-servers`.
- `/api/mcp-servers` reads Kubernetes Deployments with MCP Hub labels and maps labels/annotations into the catalog model.
- `/api/mcp-servers` is also the service-authenticated registry contract used by MCP Gateway; it returns each stable route ID and Core MCP Proxy URL.
- `/api/mcp-cache-status` keeps an empty Hub access-token-cache field for compatibility and aggregates sanitized MCP Gateway OAuth-session metadata with separate access-token and ID-JAG cache summaries from `MCP_HUB_GATEWAY_STATUS_URL`. Both access-token and ID-JAG entries include only audiences, scope, cache time, expiry, and status. It must never expose token or session credential values.
- The Tools page calls the running MCP server with JSON-RPC `tools/list` without an Athenz access token; Kubernetes annotations are not the source of truth for tools. Protocol bootstrap and tool discovery are public, while `tools/call` remains protected.
- Hub-managed deployments probe Runtime Proxy `/healthz` for liveness and `/readyz` for readiness. Runtime Proxy readiness runs the MCP-standard `initialize`, `notifications/initialized`, `ping`, and `tools/list` lifecycle against the colocated MCP container. Catalog status is derived from the Kubernetes Deployment rollout/readiness state: `Active`, `In progress`, or `Unhealthy`.
- Curated custom permission requirements start as pure settings in `config/permission-presets.yaml`. `make local` generates the `mcp-hub-permission-presets` Kubernetes ConfigMap from that file. Permission settings distinguish `defaultPermission: none`, which intentionally gives every unlisted tool no additional downstream requirement, from `defaultPermission: not-defined`, which leaves unlisted tools visibly unconfigured and fail-closed when an explicit tool map is published. Authenticated Hub users can override one tool's requirements from its permission dialog; those partial overrides are stored in the MCP Deployment's `mcp.idthw.dev/tool-permissions` annotation and take precedence over the checked-in defaults. The client-configuration page checks current direct role memberships through ZMS with the Hub's server-side certificate. Athenz remains the source of truth for real membership.
- Creating a Hub-managed MCP server uses that same server-side certificate to idempotently provision a server-specific access path in the existing `mcp-hub.mcps.<project>` domain: an initially empty `<mcp-key>-accessor` role, the `<mcp-key>-accessor-jag-exchanger` role with `mcp-hub.mcp-gateway`, the `zts.jag_exchange` policy from that exchanger role to the access role, and the `<mcp-key>-accessor-source-exchanger` role with the selected MCP service account. Creation and update never add the signed-in user to the accessor role; the creator must use the same client-configuration access request as every other user. Saving a signed-in-user tool audience adds an idempotent `zts.token_source_exchange` assertion for that target domain to the server-specific source-exchange policy. The Hub verifies that the selected service exists, generates a dedicated RSA service key, registers its public key under the deterministic per-server key ID `idthw-hub-<mcp-key>` (truncated with a stable hash when necessary), and enables the `zts_instance_launch_provider` template for that service; it never creates the project domain. Multiple MCP servers may share one Athenz service account because their access roles, exchange policies, and public-key IDs are distinct. Updates preserve legacy key IDs already stored in Runtime Proxy configuration.
- The Hub-managed client-configuration flow starts with an authenticated access request. `POST /api/mcp-servers/<mcp-key>/access` adds the current signed-in user to that server's access role and idempotently creates or repairs its managed roles, memberships, JAG policy, and configured source-exchange assertions. It also reconciles a legacy shared Deployment scope to the per-server scope before the UI proceeds to permission verification and client configuration. It never deletes legacy Athenz roles or policies.
- Confirmed deletion of a Hub-managed MCP server removes that MCP's three server-specific access roles and its JAG/source-exchange policies before deleting the Kubernetes resources. It must not delete the project-owned Athenz service account, project domain, or legacy shared access resources.
- Hub-managed creation and update also idempotently apply the project-local `mcp-runtime-proxy-athenz-ca` ConfigMap from the Hub's configured Athenz CA. New Hub-managed servers store their private key in an immutable bootstrap Secret mounted only by Runtime Proxy. Runtime Proxy obtains an X.509 service certificate from ZTS, publishes the cert/key through a separate Secret mounted read-only by both Runtime Proxy and the MCP container at `/var/run/athenz/service.{cert,key}.pem`, and refreshes it every 24 hours using a resource-name-scoped Kubernetes Role. Both containers also receive the Athenz CA as `/var/run/athenz/ca.crt` and `/var/run/athenz/ca.cert.pem`. Runtime Proxy validates protected requests against the ZTS JWKS endpoint, exact managed audience, token expiry, and the server-specific `<mcp-key>-accessor` scope without downloading Athenz policy. Protocol bootstrap, `ping`, and `tools/list` remain public.
- For configured custom tool scopes, MCP Gateway sends only the scope outside the managed route scope through the internal downstream-scope header. Runtime Proxy verifies those scopes exist in the signed incoming AT, performs mTLS token exchange with the managed MCP service identity, publishes the exchanged AT at `/var/run/idthw-access-tokens/<tool>/<request-id>.jwt`, passes the exact path through MCP request `_meta`, and removes it after the response. The shared `emptyDir` is read/write only for Runtime Proxy and read-only for the MCP container. Do not replace the request-scoped layout with a shared per-tool file because concurrent users would overwrite each other.
- Permission setup must enumerate tools from the public live MCP `tools/list` result, not from the preset. The YAML plus Deployment overrides map custom execution requirements onto those tool names. Hub-managed user, Gateway, and MCP source-exchanger requirements are generated from the deployment's managed access scope and merged into every discovered tool. Permission dialogs show editable custom **Tool permissions** first and read-only **MCP access** defaults at the bottom; auto-expand the managed-default section only when a managed membership or policy is missing. Each direct requirement leads with its audience/Athenz domain and role. For Hub-managed servers, render the derived Gateway `<role>-jag-exchanger` and MCP-service `<role>-exchanger` memberships immediately below and indented from each owning direct-access row, before the final **Add permission** control. Edit mode should mirror the visible permission table: each helper keeps its editable member and role together with zero or more editable policies containing effect, action, and resource. Do not use a helper enable/disable checkbox. Each helper and each associated policy can be added or deleted, and helpers can target MCP Gateway, the selected MCP IAM account, or a custom service account. Keep **Add policy** compact and inside its helper. An empty helper list offers **Generate default helpers**; a customized list can reset to defaults. Saving persists these helper policy expectations and provisions only the managed source-domain exchange assertion; it does not grant downstream target-domain access by itself. The consumer-facing **Request permission** button beside each tool submits only its currently missing custom downstream requirements to the Workflow Platform, while skipping every Hub-managed requirement already handled by step 1. The Workflow Platform reviewer applies the Athenz changes later with the Hub identity.
- Permission workflow requests are Kubernetes ConfigMaps in the `mcp-hub` namespace. Their versioned `data["request.json"]` document is the source of truth for request content and status; labels are only lookup indexes and must not override the document. Pending requests remain after approval with an approval report and `approved` status. The unauthenticated Workflow Platform separates Pending and Approved / Done requests and may delete approved workflow records after explicit confirmation, but cleanup must never delete pending requests or granted Athenz permissions.
- Hub-managed server creation optionally accepts a default for unlisted tools plus known tool names and their downstream permission requirements immediately after IAM service-account selection, using the same direct/helper/policy editor as the live Tools page. A known tool can be explicitly marked as requiring no additional permission; its empty requirement list is still stored so MCP Gateway receives an intentional managed-only tool mapping instead of treating the tool as unconfigured. This setup remains optional because live tools may not be known until deployment. Templates store the same settings in their Kubernetes Secret; template-based creation inherits them, lets the provider customize or remove them, and stores the final settings in the Deployment's `mcp.idthw.dev/tool-permissions` annotation. Creation and server update idempotently provision the corresponding managed source-exchange audience assertions, while downstream memberships remain external Athenz grants.
- `/api/mcp-servers` derives `toolScopes` from each configured tool's `<signed_in_user>` roles, merges the deployment's managed route scope into each one, and publishes `defaultToolPermission` separately. It also publishes `accessAudience`, defaulted from the first route-scope domain; Hub-managed manifests record the managed MCP domain explicitly so it matches Runtime Proxy's expected audience. MCP Gateway uses that audience for multi-domain Athenz access-token issuance and the exact `tools/call.params.name` mapping. An unmapped tool uses only the managed route scope when `defaultToolPermission` is `none`, and fails closed when it is `not-defined`. Legacy servers without explicit tool settings continue to use the Kubernetes `access-scope` annotation.
- On the client-configuration page, always keep up to five tool permission rows visible. When there are more than five tools, place only the remaining rows behind an `Expand tools` control so the next setup step remains immediately visible. Keep the expand/collapse control after the currently displayed tool rows.
- Permission detail dialogs use a compact table. The Athenz role value itself is the outbound link; do not add a redundant `Open in Athenz` action beside it.
- `<signed_in_user>` is the only supported dynamic permission-preset member. It must occupy the complete `member` value. Unknown or partial placeholders are configuration errors and must never be skipped in a way that could produce a false ready state.
- Most navigation and not-yet-implemented controls are disabled so missing surfaces are obvious.
- Public images live in `public/icons/` and are referenced as `/icons/<file>`.
- Selectable MCP server and template icons live in `public/mcp_icons/`. Resources store only the image filename ID in `mcp.idthw.dev/icon`; missing or unknown IDs fall back to name initials. A selected template icon is the default for servers created from that template.
- Selecting a template during MCP server creation shows the template's container source, image, port, protocol, path, command, and arguments in the same layout as direct setup, but those template-owned values are read-only. Direct MCP server creation does not suggest container images; template authoring retains its curated image suggestions.
- For the first real-data slice, prefer reading Kubernetes Deployments/Services with MCP Hub labels and annotations over adding a database.

## Recommended PR Order

Prefer small PRs that establish real product contracts:

1. Add a read-only MCP detail page for catalog rows.
2. Add a mock `Register MCP server` page with fields for name, project, image, transport, port, service account, replicas, tools, and managed policies.
3. Add local mock persistence for registered MCP servers.
4. Add a generated Kubernetes manifest preview from the registration form.
5. Wire a backend action/API that can create a Kubernetes Deployment and Service.
6. Add health, logs, and rollout status once deployment creation exists.

## Data Model Hints

Keep these concepts separate:

- MCP server identity: name, project, description, icon, owner/provider project.
- Runtime deployment: image, transport, port, replicas, service account, env vars, health checks.
- Managed policies: provider-owned default policy templates for tools.
- Grants/attachments: consumer/project-owned ID-JAG permissions that allow agents or users to call the MCP tools.

Initial Kubernetes metadata can be modeled with labels and annotations such as:

- `app.kubernetes.io/part-of=mcp-hub`
- `mcp.idthw.dev/alias=<optional-display-alias>` as an annotation when the alias contains spaces.
- `mcp.idthw.dev/id=<globally-unique-route-id>` is the stable ID used in `/mcp/{id}`; it defaults to the deployment name.
- `mcp.idthw.dev/access-scope=<space-separated-Athenz-scopes>` optionally tells MCP Gateway which per-user AT scope to request for this route.
- `mcp.idthw.dev/project=<project-name>` is required for catalog listing.
- `mcp.idthw.dev/description=<description>`
- `mcp.idthw.dev/public-url=<externally-reachable-mcp-url>` for client configuration and live tool discovery.
- `mcp.idthw.dev/transport=<transport>`

## UI Guidance

- Keep the screen operational and dense, similar to an internal control plane.
- Keep the black top bar, gray sidebar, white content area, tabbed catalog, filter row, and flat table style unless the user asks to redesign.
- Use disabled controls for planned surfaces that are not wired yet.
- Avoid company-specific names, URLs, or screenshots in source.
- Keep copy generic to IDTHW, MCP Hub, ID-JAG, Kubernetes, and Athenz.

## Commands

```sh
make local
npm run lint
npm run build
```

`npm run build` may need permission in sandboxed environments because Next/Turbopack can spawn workers and bind local ports.

## Next.js Note

This project uses Next.js 16. If framework behavior is unclear, check the installed docs or existing app patterns before assuming older Next.js conventions.
