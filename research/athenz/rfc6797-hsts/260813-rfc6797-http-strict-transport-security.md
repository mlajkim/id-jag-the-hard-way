# Goal

The goal of this document is to verify that the Athenz ZMS and ZTS HTTPS interfaces implement the RFC 6797 HTTP Strict Transport Security standard and demonstrate how an HSTS-aware client upgrades a later HTTP request to HTTPS, with the following steps:

# Prerequisites

This tutorial requires the following to be completed:

1. Complete the main [ID-JAG The Hard Way tutorial](https://github.com/mlajkim/id-jag-the-hard-way/tree/main/tutorials).
2. Keep the tutorial's Kubernetes cluster running.
3. Keep `./tools/keep-k8s-port-forward.sh` running in another terminal.
4. Run all commands from the ID-JAG The Hard Way repository root.

# Steps

Here is the procedure to get to the goals.

## Step 1. Confirm ZMS and ZTS are running

Confirm that both Athenz servers are available before testing their HTTPS responses:

```sh
kubectl -n athenz get deployment athenz-zms-server athenz-zts-server
```

```sh
# NAME                READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
# athenz-zms-server   1/1     1            1           ...
# athenz-zts-server   1/1     1            1           ...
```

Both deployments must show `1/1` under `READY`. If they are ready but the next step cannot connect, restart `./tools/keep-k8s-port-forward.sh`.

## Step 2. Verify HSTS on successful responses

Check the unauthenticated status endpoint on ZMS:

```sh
curl -skS \
  -D - \
  -o /dev/null \
  -w 'HTTP status: %{http_code}\n' \
  "https://localhost:$(./tools/port.sh zms)/zms/v1/status"
```

```sh
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
# Host: athenz-zms-server-b979dc499-qz6jg
# Content-Type: application/json
# Content-Length: 27

# HTTP status: 200
```

Check the same feature on ZTS `Strict-Transport-Security`:

```sh
curl -skS \
  -D - \
  -o /dev/null \
  -w 'HTTP status: %{http_code}\n' \
  "https://localhost:$(./tools/port.sh zts)/zts/v1/status"
```

```sh
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
# Host: athenz-zts-server-...
# Content-Type: application/json
# Content-Length: 27

# HTTP status: 200
```

These checks connect to the direct ZMS and ZTS port-forwards. Therefore, the observed header comes from Athenz rather than from the Athenz UI, an ingress, or another reverse proxy. The `-k` option is intentional for this local test because ID-JAG The Hard Way uses locally generated certificates; the test is checking whether Athenz emits the header, not whether the workstation trusts the tutorial CA.

## Step 3. Compare an HTTP request before and after learning HSTS

Send an HTTP request that is not permitted by Athenz's default HTTPS-only listener:

```sh
curl -skS \
  --max-time 5 \
  -D - \
  -o /dev/null \
  -w 'Effective URL: %{url_effective}\nHTTP status: %{http_code}\n' \
  "http://localhost:$(./tools/port.sh zms)/zms/v1/status"
```

```sh
# curl: (1) Received HTTP/0.9 when not allowed
# Effective URL: http://localhost:4443/zms/v1/status
# HTTP status: 000
```

The exact curl error can vary by version. The stable result is that the effective URL remains `http://` and no HTTP response is received (`000`). This failure is not caused by HSTS: plaintext HTTP was sent to a port that expects a TLS handshake, so the request never reaches the ZMS API as a valid HTTP request.

Now create a temporary empty file that curl can use as its HSTS cache. `--hsts "${_hsts_cache}"` tells curl to read and update that file:

```sh
_hsts_cache=$(mktemp)

curl -skS \
  --hsts "${_hsts_cache}" \
  -D - \
  -o /dev/null \
  -w 'Effective URL: %{url_effective}\nHTTP status: %{http_code}\n' \
  "https://localhost:$(./tools/port.sh zms)/zms/v1/status"
```

```sh
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
# Host: athenz-zms-server-...
# Content-Type: application/json
# Content-Length: 27

# Effective URL: https://localhost:4443/zms/v1/status
# HTTP status: 200
```

Repeat the original `http://` URL, this time with the learned HSTS cache:

```sh
curl -skS \
  --hsts "${_hsts_cache}" \
  -D - \
  -o /dev/null \
  -w 'Effective URL: %{url_effective}\nHTTP status: %{http_code}\n' \
  "http://localhost:$(./tools/port.sh zms)/zms/v1/status"
```

```sh
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
# Host: athenz-zms-server-...
# Content-Type: application/json
# Content-Length: 27

# Effective URL: https://localhost:4443/zms/v1/status
# HTTP status: 200
```

Although the input URL used `http://`, curl changed the effective URL to `https://` before sending the request. That client-side upgrade is the protection HSTS provides against insecure fallback.

Remove the temporary curl cache:

```sh
rm -f "${_hsts_cache}"
unset _hsts_cache
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `-k` option keeps this local demonstration simple with tutorial-generated certificates. Production browsers learn HSTS only from a valid HTTPS connection. This procedure demonstrates the upgrade behavior; it does not reproduce a real man-in-the-middle or SSL-stripping attack.

## Step 4. Verify HSTS on error responses

The Athenz Jetty response-header rule applies to every request path. Use a path that does not exist and verify that the HSTS header remains present on the ZMS `404` response:

```sh
curl -skS \
  -D - \
  -o /dev/null \
  -w 'HTTP status: %{http_code}\n' \
  "https://localhost:$(./tools/port.sh zms)/zms/v1/hsts-test-not-found" \
  | tr -d '\r' \
  | grep -Ei '^(Strict-Transport-Security:|HTTP status:)'
```

```sh
# Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
# HTTP status: 404
```

Repeat the error-response check against ZTS:

```sh
curl -skS \
  -D - \
  -o /dev/null \
  -w 'HTTP status: %{http_code}\n' \
  "https://localhost:$(./tools/port.sh zts)/zts/v1/hsts-test-not-found" \
  | tr -d '\r' \
  | grep -Ei '^(Strict-Transport-Security:|HTTP status:)'
```

```sh
# Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
# HTTP status: 404
```

The four successful checks prove that both Athenz services publish the policy on normal and error responses. `max-age=31536000` asks a user agent to remember the HTTPS-only policy for one year, and `includeSubDomains` extends that policy to subdomains of the hostname that delivered it.

This test validates the deployed behavior associated with PR #3361 without depending on its internal unit tests. It does not isolate whether the value came from the Jetty container's built-in default or an explicit `athenz.response_headers_json` deployment property. Step 3 demonstrates curl's HSTS cache, not a specific browser's storage or HSTS preload behavior.
